Blog Site with Comment Section
📌 Project Overview
The Blog Site with comment section is a responsive and interactive web application that allows users to create, view, and comment on blog posts — all from the browser. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with localStorage for managing post and comment data.

This project demonstrates how a fully functional blog platform can be created entirely on the frontend — without requiring a backend server — while maintaining a smooth, dynamic user experience.

🎯 Objective
To design and implement an intuitive blog management system that enables users to create, read, and interact with blogs in a seamless, lightweight, and responsive interface.

🧩 Features
✍️ Add Blog: Users can write and publish blog posts.
📄 View Blog: Each post has its own detailed page.
💬 Comment Section: Readers can comment on individual blogs.
💾 LocalStorage Integration: Data persists locally in the user’s browser.
📱 Responsive Design: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

🚀 Limitations
Blogs and comments are stored only in browser localStorage, meaning:

Each visitor sees only their own posts/comments.
Blogs do not sync globally across users or devices.
